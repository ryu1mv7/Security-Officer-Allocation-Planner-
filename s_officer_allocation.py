            After I applied to fold fulkerson method, I need to find which edges has weight of 1 for scheduling.
            To find that I used special bfs(not bfs actually), to traverse the edge which weight is 1 in FN.
            I traverse employee -> intermidiate node -> day_shift -> company
            After I get index of each nodes above, I converted them into index which is usable for allocation list.
